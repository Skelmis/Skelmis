### I like to build cool things which make a difference.

__*The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?*__

My software has been used by millions of people worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of developers choosing my platforms as the base used to build products which scale.

My skillset in a sentence: A strong Python developer skilled at building software that scales to hundreds of thousands of users while remaining responsive, performant and requiring low maintenance.

I am open to all forms of communication, feel free to add me and ask about anything!
